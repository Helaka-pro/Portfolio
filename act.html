                        <h2> Basketball</h2>
                        <p style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 30px;">Basketball is one of my favourite activities because it is fast-paced and highly engaging. It helps improve physical fitness by building strength, stamina, and coordination. Playing basketball also enhances teamwork and communication skills, as players must work together to achieve a common goal. Additionally, basketball supports mental well-being by reducing stress and improving focus. In the long term, it can create opportunities such as participating in tournaments, developing leadership skills, and even pursuing careers related to sports coaching or fitness training. <button class="button"><a href="https://www.nba.com/">Info</a></button></p>

                    <p style="font-weight: 600;  font-size: 20px; margin-top: 480px;">Badminton is an activity I enjoy because it requires quick reflexes, agility, and strategic thinking. It is an excellent form of exercise that improves cardiovascular health, balance, and flexibility. Badminton can be played both recreationally and competitively, making it suitable for people of all ages. One of its main advantages is that it enhances concentration and decision-making skills. The activity can also lead to opportunities such as competitive play, coaching, or involvement in sports clubs and community events. <button class="button"><a href="https://bwfbadminton.com/">Info</a></button></p>

                        <p style="font-weight: 600;  font-size: 20px; margin-top: 480px;">Swimming is a favourite activity because it is both relaxing and physically beneficial. It is a full-body exercise that strengthens muscles, improves lung capacity, and increases overall endurance. Swimming is especially valuable as it places minimal stress on the joints, making it suitable for long-term health and fitness. In addition, swimming promotes mental relaxation and helps reduce anxiety. The advantages of swimming include improved physical health, discipline, and potential opportunities in areas such as lifeguarding, professional training, or competitive swimming.<button class="button"><a href="https://www.worldaquatics.com/">Info</a></button></p>
